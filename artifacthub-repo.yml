ignore:
  # We ignore all but the stable versions of the charts with release management
  # (jupyterhub/pebble). I've disabled binderhub for now until its discussed to
  # publish it further.
  #
  # The version field is a regex of RE2 kind that doesn't support negative
  # lookaheads, so trying to ignore all but the releases following a certain
  # pattern isn't possible I think.
